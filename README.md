We assigned a score to each article based on the overlap between the article’s tags and the user’s preferred tags. To enhance this further, we computed the semantic similarity between the sets of tags using **cosine similarity** on their embeddings. The final score for each article combines both the direct tag match score and the embedding-based similarity score, allowing us to capture both exact matches and semantically related content.
